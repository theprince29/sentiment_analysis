# Sentiment Analysis with Bag-of-Words and Logistic Regression

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) technique and logistic regression. The model is trained to classify text documents as either positive or negative sentiment.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as a review, tweet, or comment. In this project, we utilize the Bag-of-Words approach, which represents each document as a vector of word frequencies, and logistic regression to classify the sentiment of the text.

## Features

- **Bag-of-Words Representation**: Transforming text data into numerical vectors based on word frequency.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: A simple yet effective classification algorithm used for sentiment analysis.
- **Flask Web Application**: Deploy the trained model as a web service using Flask, allowing users to input text and receive sentiment predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
    cd sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Training the Model:

    - Prepare your dataset of text documents labeled with sentiment (positive or negative).
    - Run the training script to train the sentiment analysis model:

        ```
        python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
        ```

2. Starting the Flask Web Application:

    - Launch the Flask web application to interact with the trained model:

        ```
        python app.py
        ```

    - Access the web application at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
